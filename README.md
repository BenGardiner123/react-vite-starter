## Getting Started

To begin your React Vite journey, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or by downloading the source code directly.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command `npm install`.
4. Once the installation is complete, start the development server with `npm run dev`.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5174` to see your React application in action.

## Building for Production

When your React application is ready for deployment, you can create an optimized production build. Run the following command:
